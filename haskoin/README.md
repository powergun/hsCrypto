This git repository contains code referenced in an article [Rolling your own Blockchain in Haskell](http://www.michaelburge.us/2017/08/17/rolling-your-own-blockchain.html).

If you are instead looking for a popular Bitcoin implementation also written in Haskell, you want [Haskoin](https://github.com/haskoin/haskoin).

Both projects share the same name, but are otherwise unrelated.
